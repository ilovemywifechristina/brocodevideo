x = 3.14
y = 4
z = 5

#use this to round up or down
#result = round(x)
#abs means absoloute value, so if y equals -4 then the absoloute vaulue would be 4
#result = abs(y)
#power funtion, like 4 to the 3rd power
#result = pow(4, 3)
#the max is the highest number of the 3 variables so if x=1 y=2= z=3 then the max would be 3
#result = max(x, y, z)
#the min is the lowest number of the 3 variables so if x=1 y=2= z=3 then the min would be 1
#result = min(x, y, z)
#print(result)
